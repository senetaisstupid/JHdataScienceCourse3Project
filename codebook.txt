The dataset was downloaded from the URL as described in README. The datasets of subject_test, X_test, y_test, 
subject_train, X_train, and y_train were loaded into R and processed. The training data and testing data were
combined. The data of subject, X (which contains the selected feature variables) and y (contains the class of 
activities) were also combined. Only the variables measuring on the mean and standard deviation were selected
(see the list below). The data were then grouped by the subject and activity to calculate the mean of each
selected measurement.  The result was save as "bodyMoving_ave.Rda" with 81 columns and 180 rows.


The following 79 features were selected as the feature variables in dataset "bodyMoving_avg". The numbers ahead 
of the names indicate the position of the feature variables in the original datasets X_train and X_test.
